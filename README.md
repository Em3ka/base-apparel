## My process

### Built with

### What I learned

This was another great challenge to put my HTML and CSS skills to the test. Although this doesn't remove the need to use JavaScript, it reinforces the endless possibilities of CSS. My goal was to explore the limitless capabilities offered by CSS without a heavy reliance on JavaScript.
